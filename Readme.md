# In Between Derived Worlds
You are one of travellers caught in the snow storm, when you were approaching
The Gate - the monument built in tribute to the Rift that torn your
world apart.

You entered the small wooden house that happened to be near your destination -
and so did few other pilgrims. Now, stuck where you are, you try to find out
who they are.
